# LICENSE PLATE DETECTION


Created a fastapi API endpoint to detect license plate numbers. To try it out simply run 

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt `
2. `uvicorn main:app --reload`
3. Go to the `\docs` page to test it out by upload the images from the test_images folder (or your own images !)
